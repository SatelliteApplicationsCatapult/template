Inventorthon Projects Title 
============================

This is the template repo that contains all the documents necessary for submitting to Inventorthon. 

Every repo submitted to the Catapult must have the following fils at the root (i.e. not in any folder) 

1. An open source license. 
This can be achived easily [using githib's built in selection of license](https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license).

2. A readme.md that provides an overview for the technical solution:
  * overview of solution
  * basic code documentation
  * list of team members (with twitter/github handle where applicable) 

_Note: The readme.md is written in markdown - for more details on formatting in markdown, see [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you prefer, html will also work well for formatting._
