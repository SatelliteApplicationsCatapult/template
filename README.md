# Inventorthon Project Template 


This is the template repo that contains all the documents necessary for submitting to Inventorthon. 

## Things that must be included in the repo

Every repo submitted to the Catapult must have the following fils at the root (i.e. not in any folder) 

1. An open source license. 
This can be achived easily [using githib's built in selection of license](https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license).

2. A readme.md that provides an overview for the technical solution:
  * overview of solution
  * basic code documentation
  * list of team members (with twitter/github handle where applicable) 

_Note: The readme.md is written in markdown - for more details on formatting in markdown, see [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you prefer, html will also work well for formatting._

## How to use Github

If you have not used github before - we suggest you:

1. create a repo - give it whatever name you choose, initialise the repo with a readme.md and an open source license. ([instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo))
2. Update the readme.md with the required inforamtion as described above
3. Send [marketing@sa.catapult.org.uk](mailto:marketing@sa.catapult.org.uk) the link of your github repo, we'll fork it.
